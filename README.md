Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Customer Transaction Patterns
**Introduction**

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer transactions to uncover valuable insights and patterns. By leveraging two key datasets—one containing detailed customer information and the other capturing transaction data—we aim to analyze account activities and transaction trends.

The customer dataset provides comprehensive details on various aspects of customer accounts, including their status and product group associations. The transaction dataset offers a granular view of financial transactions, including amounts, timestamps, and descriptions.

The objective of this analysis is to identify trends, detect anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior. These insights will help in making informed decisions, enhancing customer engagement, and improving overall banking strategies and services.
